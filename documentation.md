# Documentation

📚 BackstopJS's documentation is top-notch and I recommend having it open as we go through the workshop and anytime you're working on your visual testing suite. Find it [here](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS). 

🕶 To watch the demo that got me started on BackstopJS, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JvqXIkxBqo&t=2104s). It's a recording of a workshop [David Needham](https://www.davidneedham.me/) gave at KC's Drupal Flyover Camp in 2019. His slides can be found [here](https://visual-regression.davidneedham.me/#).
