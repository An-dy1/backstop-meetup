# Your first BackstopJS test

From the command line, globally install BackstopJS.

```text
$ npm install -g backstopjs
```

Check that it installed successfully.

```text
$ backstopjs -v
```

Make a directory to store your project.

```text
$ mkdir <folder_name>
```

Enter that directory.

```text
$ cd <folder_name>
```

Initialize a new BackstopJS project in that directory.

```text
$ backstop init
```

Navigate to your IDE of choice and open your project directory there. You'll have two things in there: a directory called **backstop\_data** and a file called **backstop.json**.
